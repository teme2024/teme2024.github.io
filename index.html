    <h2>Theory and Experiments in Monetary Economics Conference 2024</h2>
<p>
    Sponsored by the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, this conference explores the application of experimental methods in macroeconomics and finance. 
    While experimental methods are widespread in microeconomics, they are less common in these fields. However, these methods have significant advantages in macroeconomics and finance, particularly as monetary models have evolved with explicit micro foundations that lend themselves to laboratory implementations.

    Following the successful TEME conferences in 2018, 2019 and 2022, we will host another conference on Theory and Experiments in Monetary Economics (TEME). Organized by Daniel Houser and Daniela Puzzello, the TEME conference will feature three keynote addresses and a dozen plenary sessions spread over two days. 
    The conference and the associated special issue of the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization aim to foster the exchange of ideas among participants and to advance research at the frontier of experimental methods in monetary theory and macroeconomic monetary policy.
